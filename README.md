## üöß Technology Stack

- **Server Enviornment** - NodeJS
- **Framework** - ExpressJS
- **Bundler** - Webpack
- **For APIs** - GraphQL in conjunction with Apollo
- **Frontend** - ReactJS, Chakra UI
- **Database** - MongoDB in conjunction with Mongoose
- **Cloud database service** - MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment** - Heroku (Backend) & Netlify (Frontend)

Authentication is implemented using a JSON Web Token (JWT) saved in local storage. Upon a successful login attempt made to the GraphQL endpoint, the response is a JWT containing the user data. This token is then added to every API request that requires authorisation.
